<?php

// 1. Our original string.
//print "Hello again, <em>world</em>!";

// 2. A multiple-lined string.
//print "Hello again,
//<em>world</em>!";

// 3. Using the \n special character to add a new line.
//print "Hello again,\n<em>world</em>!";

// 4. How you use quotes is important. The new line doesn't work with single quotes.
//print 'Hello again,\n<em>world</em>!';

// 5. Single quotes can be used in double quotes and vice-versa.
//print "Hello again, 'world!'";

// 6. But to use the same kind of quote, you have to escape them.
//print "Hello again, \"world!\"";

// 7. The . is used to concatenate (add together) multiple strings.
//print "Hello again, " . "<em>world</em>!";
